Thanks for downloading Pixel Monsters Free Pack!
Your support is greatly appreciated!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I prefer to be credited as 'Matthew Ashworth', though 'Matseb2611' is also fine.

This pack contains 5 different characters, each one containing a variety
of different animated poses.
There are 2 versions of the Armed Ghost and 2 versions of the Evil Skull.

The 4-directional spritesheets of each character are useful for top down games, 
such as 2D JRPGs.
The side-view only spritesheets can be used either in side-view turn-based battles
or in sidescrollers and 2D platformers.
Though in the end it is up to you how to use them in a game.

Each character has an idle pose that is useful for cycling through the frames while the 
character is stationary to give them a more life-like feel. 
They also have walking/moving poses, as well as a dying pose.
The first frame of the dying pose can be used for when the character simply gets hit.

Generally, although all spritesheets have been designed for specific actions, you can 
also experiment with different frames to create new behaviours.
Animated GIF files have been provided as a sort of an example of how some of the poses
look when in action.

I post some alternate colour versions and other variations of these and other sprites
on my Patreon. If you like these, I'd highly appreciate your support on there too!
(The $5/month tier will get you access to these alt versions).
